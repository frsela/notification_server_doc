    WAKEUP API [WIP]
This (WIP) API will be offered by the carriers in order to be able to wakeup handsets inside their own mobile networks.

Connection to this API will be protected with client certificates signed by the carrier so only trusted 3rd. party notification servers will be able to send datagrams to the handsets.
