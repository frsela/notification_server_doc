    Today mobile applications retrieve asynchronously information from multiple sites.
    Developers have two ways to retrieve this information:
  </p><p>
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        Polling: Periodically query the information to the server.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        Push: The server sends the information to the client when the required
        information is available.
      </li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    The first method is strongly discouraged due to the large number of connections
    made to the server needlessly, because information is not available and you lose time and resources.
  </p><p>
    That is why the PUSH methods are widely used for information retrieval,
    anyway how PUSH platforms are currently working are misusing mobile radio
    resources and also consuming lot of battery.
  </p><p>
    This article aims to explain how to manage this kind of messaging, problems
    with existing solutions and finally how Telefónica Digital, within the framework
    of the development of Firefox OS operating system, a new solution designed
    friendlier to the network and low battery consumption on mobile terminals.
  </p><div class="section" title="State of the art"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="idp65120"/>State of the art</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Historically mobile operators offered (and offer) real mechanisms PUSH notifications,
      also known as WAP PUSH. WAP PUSH can "wake up" applications when any action
      is required of them by the server side (without interaction from the user).
      Sending WAP PUSH messages is done in the domain of circuits, the same used
      for voice and SMS, and that is why the user don't need to establish a data connection.
      These kind messages work properly out of the box.
    </p><p>
      WAP PUSH solutions works great when the user is registered in the mobile network,
      but if you are out of coverage or connected to a WiFi hotspot instead a celular
      network, you can not receive these messages.
    </p><p>
      Also, if we add that this messages implies an economic cost (basically it
      is a short message SMS) the effect is that major smartphone operating systems
      (Apple iOS and Google Android) have implemented a parallel solution that would
      work regardless of the mobile network to which the user belongs and it can
      run smoothly when they are using WiFi networks.
    </p><div class="section" title="Current Internet solutions issues"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp67152"/>Current Internet solutions issues</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Internet PUSH solutions are based on a public accesible server which handles
        all the notification delivery.
      </p><p>
        These solutions were designed without considering the mobile networks
        way of working and forces the handset to maintain an open socket with
        the server in order to avoid misnotifications.
      </p><p>
        This way of working increases the signalling and the handsets battery
        consume.
        For more information about this, please refer to the
        "<a class="xref" href="#network_issues" title="Chapter 2. Mobile network issues with current PUSH platforms">Mobile network issues with current PUSH platforms</a>" chapter
      </p></div></div><div class="section" title="Service Description"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="idp69120"/>Service Description</h2></div></div></div><p>
      The Notification Server platform is aimed to deliver push notifications
      (small messages like a real-time chat, a JSON data structure defining
      the goal of a soccer match) to web based terminals inside mobile networks.
    </p><p>
      The main objective of this service is to deliver these messages
      considering the way of working of the mobile radio so the battery
      consumption and traffic generated is reduced to the minimal.
      It is developed for working on stable Internet connections, like on
      Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

      Since we want a service to be used, we think it to be very easy to use
      and to be great for developers.
    </p><p>
      Now, we point out some adventages with the use of this solution:

    This chapter explains why current solutions are bad for the mobile networks
    and how we designed this server to solve this issues.
  </p><p>
    In order to understand the complete problem, we need to introduce you on how
    the mobile nerworks work at radio level and also how the carriers have their
    network infrastructure. So, go ahead !
  </p><div class="section" title="Mobile networks in a Private or Public LAN"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="idp96160"/>Mobile networks in a Private or Public LAN</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Since on IPv4 the amount of free adresses is really low, celular networks
      were divided into the ones with real IPv4 adresses (normally for 3G modems)
      and private adressing model for handsets.
    </p><p>
      On the case of private networks, it's obvious that it's not possible to
      directly notify the handset when the server has a notification for it, so
      smartphone manufacturers decided to maintain opened channels with their
      servers so it's possible to notify handsets asynchronously.
    </p><p>
      On the other hand, if the handset has a public address, or is using IPv6,
      it's teorically possible to send the message directly making third party
      solutions unuseful, however in order to protect users, carriers can deploy
      firewalls to avoid direct access from Internet to the handset.
    </p></div><div class="section" title="Mobile Network. Circuit domain states"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="idp98072"/>Mobile Network. Circuit domain states</h2></div></div></div><p>
      In the 3GPP TS 25.331 specification, we can query all the circuit domain
      statues of the RRC Layer (Radio Resource Control).
    </p><p>
      In order to simplify, we only list the third generation (3G) states:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
          Cell_DCH (Dedicated Channel)
          <p>
            When the handset is in this state is because it has a dedicated
            channel on the mobile network.
          </p><p>
            Normally the network sets a handsent into this state when it's
            transmitting a big amount of data.
          </p><p>
            The inactivity time of this state is really short, known as T1 timer
            it should vary between 5 and 20 seconds. If T1 is fired, the handset
            will be changed to the Cell_FACH state.
          </p></li><li class="listitem">
          Cell_FACH
          <p>
            In this state the handset is connected to the mobile network using
            a shared channel with other handsets.
          </p><p>
            Normally, this state is assigned by the network when the handset is
            transmitting a small amount of data.
            So it's common to use it when sending keep-alive packages.
          </p><p>
            The inactivity time of this state is a little longer (30 seconds) and
            is konwn as T2 timer. When T2 timer is shotted, the handset will be
            moved to Cell_PCH or URA_PCH (depending on the type of network)
          </p></li><li class="listitem">
          Cell_PCH or URA_PCH (PCH: Paging Channel) (URA: UTRAN Registration Area)
          <p>
            In this state the handset is not able to send any data except
            signalling information in order to be able to localize the handset
            inside the celullar network.
          </p><p>
            In both states, the RRC connection is established and open, but it's
            rarely used.
          </p><p>
            In this state, the handset informs the network every time the device
            change from one sector to another so the network is able to known
            exactly the BTS which is offering service to the device.
          </p><p>
            The T3 timer defines the maximum time to be in a PCH state. This timer
            is longer than T1 and T2 and depends on each carrier. When it's fired
            the handset is moved to IDLE mode so if new data transmission is needed
            the handset will need near 2 seconds to restablish the channel and a
            lot of signalling messages.
          </p></li><li class="listitem">
          RRC_IDLE
          <p>
            This is the most economical state since the handset radio is practically
            stopped.
          </p><p>
            In this state, the radio is only listening to radio messages quering
            the handset to "Wake Up" (paging messages).
          </p><p>
            Also, the handset modem is listening the cell data so each time it
            detects that the user changed from one LAC (Localization Area Code -
            Group of multiple BTS) to another, the handset will change to the
            PCH state in order to inform the network.
          </p><p>
            So when a handset is in this state, it can be Waked Up to a more
            active state and also the network knowns the LAC where the handset
            is moving, so if the network needs to inform the handset it should
            send a broadcast paging message through all the LAC BTS in order to
            locate the handset.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
      The following scheme represent the different radio states ordered by
      power comsuption on the device:

      In the 3GPP TS 23.060 specification, we can analyse all the package domain
      states of the GMM Layer (GPRS Mobility Management).
    </p><p>
      The package domain states are simpler than radio ones (only 3 states):
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        READY (2G) / PMM_CONNECTED (3G)
        <p>
          The handset has a PDP context established and is able to send and
          receive data.
        </p></li><li class="listitem">
        STANDBY (2G) / PMM_IDLE (3G)
        <p>
          The handset isn't transmitting anything but the PDP context is not
          closed, so it maintains a valid IP address.
        </p><p>
          In this state the handset don't consume any resource but the network is
          maintaining his IP address as a valid one, so it's very important to try
          to maintain the handset in this state in order to be able to Wake Up
          it and change to a PMM_CONNECTED state in order to transmit/receive
          information.
        </p></li><li class="listitem">
        IDLE (2G) / PMM_DETACHED (3G)
        <p>
          In this state, the handset hasn't a PDP context established so it hasn't
          a valid IP address.
        </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Mobile Network. States relation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="idp111992"/>Mobile Network. States relation</h2></div></div></div><p>
      In this section we show the relation between RRC and GMM states.
    </p><p>
      In order to simplify this table, we only consider the handset is only using
      data channels, so no voice nor SMS (circuit domain) is being used.

              <p>
                Also it's possible that the handset is transmiting or receiving
                small amount of data like pings, keep-alives, cell updates,...

              <p>
                However, the signalling channel is available and is able to change
                to a data transmission state like FACH or DCH with a little amount

      This is a carrier well-know effect after the big adoption of smartphones
      around the word.
    </p><p>
      As we explained in previous sections, each time the network decides to
      move a handset from one state to another is needed to restablish channels
      and starts a negotiation between the network and the handset with the
      signalling protocol.

      Since nowadays handsets are sending keep-alives to maintain their connections
      opened, the efect is that the handsets is continously changing from one
      state to another producing a lot of signalling in the network and also
      consumes a lot of battery resources.

    The Notification Server API is based on the W3C draft:
    <a class="link" href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/push/raw-file/default/index.html" target="">
      [http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/push/raw-file/default/index.html]
    </a>
  </p><p>
    In order to understand this chapter, we'll present the different actors:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        WebApp (WA):
        <p>
          The user's applications which is normally executed on the
          user device.
        </p></li><li class="listitem">
        User Agent (UA):
        <p>
          Since this protocol born under the Firefox OS umbrella the
          "operating system" layer is known as the User Agent layer, in our case
          is the Gecko engine.
        </p></li><li class="listitem">
        Notification Server (NS):
        <p>
          Centralized infrastructure of the notification
          server platform. This one can be freely deployed by anyone since it's
          open source:
          <a class="link" href="https://github.com/telefonicaid/notification_server" target="">
            [https://github.com/telefonicaid/notification_server]
          </a>.
          The protocol also allows to use any server infrastructure the user wants
        </p></li><li class="listitem">
        Application server (AS):
        <p>
          The WA server side. Normally the applications that runs on a
          mobile device use one or more Internet servers.
        </p><p>
          Some of them will be deployed by the same developer as the client application.
        </p><p>
          In our case, this server will be the one which send the notification to
          his clients/users.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    <img src="resources/actors_and_channels.png" style="text-align: middle" width="450"/>

    The following sequence diagram shows a tipical message flow between actors:

  </p><div xml:lang="en" class="section" title="API between WebApp and the User Agent"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="api_wa_ua"/>API between WebApp and the User Agent</h2></div></div></div><p>
    This API is mainly based on the W3C draft as specified in
    <a class="link" href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/push/raw-file/default/index.html" target="">
      [http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/push/raw-file/default/index.html]
    </a>
  </p><p>
    Also there is more information about Simple PUSH API here:
    <a class="link" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush" target="">
      [https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush]
    </a>
  </p><p>
    With this API the application is able to register notification
    channels itself into the Notification Server and recover the public URL
    to be used as the notification endpointURL by his Application Server (AS).
  </p><p>
    This API (under the navigator.pushNotification object) defines these methods:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        register
      </li><li class="listitem">
        unregister
      </li><li class="listitem">
        registrations
      </li></ul></div><p>
    </p><div class="section" title="navigator.pushNotification.register"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idp135840"/>navigator.pushNotification.register</h4></div></div></div><p>
        This method allows the application to register a new channel.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
        
        navigator.pushNotification.register()
        
        </pre><p>
      </p><p>
        Finally this method will response asynchronously with the URL to be
        sent to the AS in order to be able to send notifications.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
        
        var req = navigator.pushNotification.register();
        req.onsuccess = function(e) {
          alert("Received URL: " + req.result.pushEndpoint);
        };
        req.onerror = function(e) {
          alert("Error registering app");
        }
        
      </pre></div><p>

    </p><div class="section" title="navigator.pushNotification.unregister"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idp138032"/>navigator.pushNotification.unregister</h4></div></div></div><p>
        This method allows the application to unregister a previously registered
        channel.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
        
        navigator.pushNotification.unregister(endPointURL);
        
      </pre></div><p>
  </p><p>
    After register the application into the Notification Server, all received
    notification through the given URL will be delivered to the WA registered
    channel.
  </p><p>
    Since the notifications will be received by the UA it's needed a way to
    notify each application. The current specification is using the new
    System Messages infrastructure defined in FirefoxOS.
  </p><p>
    In this case, the application shall register to the "push-notification"
    event handler:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
    
    navigator.mozSetMessageHandler("push", function(msg) {
      alert("New Message with body: " + JSON.stringify(msg));
    });
    
    </pre><p>
  </p><p>
    Inside the msg you'll receive the pushEndpoint URL so an app can register
    as many channels as it wants and with this attribute has a chance to
    differenciate one from another.
  </p><p>
    The complete example:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      
        var emailEndpoint, imEndpoint;

        // The user has logged in, now's a good time to register the channels
        MyAppFramework.addEventListener('user-login', function() {
          setupAppRegistrations();
        });

        function setupAppRegistrations() {
         // Issue a register() call
         // to register to listen for a notification,
         // you simply call push.register
         // Here, we'll register a channel for "email" updates.
         // Channels can be for anything the app would like to get notifications for.
         var reqEmail = navigator.pushNotification.register();
         reqEmail.onsuccess = function(e) {
           emailEndpoint = e.target.result.pushEndpoint;
           storeOnAppServer("email", emailEndpoint); // This is the "Hand wavey" way that the App 
                                                     // sends the endPoint back to the AppServer
         }

         // We'll also register a second channel for "im", because we're social and all about the socialists. Or something.
         var reqIm = navigator.pushNotification.register();
         reqIm.onsuccess = function(e) {
           imEndpoint = e.target.result.pushEndpoint;
           storeOnAppServer("im", imEndpoint);
         }
        }

        // Once we've registered, the AppServer can send version pings to the EndPoint.
        // This will trigger a 'push' message to be sent to this handler.
        navigator.mozSetMessageHandler('push', function handlePushMessage(message) {
          if (message.pushEndpoint == emailEndpoint)   // Yay! New Email! Steve and blue can dance!
            getNewEmailMessagesFromAppServer(message.version);
          else if (message.pushEndpoint == imEndpoint) // Yay! An IM awaits. I wonder if it's Sam's IM?
            getNewChatMessagesFromAppServer();
        });

        // to unregister, you simply call..
        AppFramework.addEventListener('user-logout', function() {
          navigator.pushNotification.unregister(emailEndpoint);
          navigator.pushNotification.unregister(imEndpoint);
        });
      
    </pre><p>

    With this API the client device is able to register his applications and
    itself into the selected notification server.
  </p><p>
    This API isn't yet standarised, anyway the one explained here is an 
    on working proposal.
  </p><p>
    The UA-NS API is divided in two transport protocols:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        HTTP API: Through the HTTP transport protocol the NS will deliver
        some information about server status.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        WebSocket API: This is the most important one since all the
        communications with the NS SHALL be driven through this API.
        <p>
          On future releases will be supported another channels as Long-Polling
          solutions in order to cover devices which don't support Web Sockets.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><div class="section" title="HTTP API"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idp171272"/>HTTP API</h4></div></div></div><p>
        This channel only offers one method to get server information.
      </p><div class="section" title="about"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="idp171936"/>about</h5></div></div></div><p>
          This method responds an HTML page with general information about the
          running server like number of connections, number of process running...
        </p></div></div><p>
    </p><div class="section" title="WebSocket API"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idp172848"/>WebSocket API</h4></div></div></div><p>
        Through this channel the device will register itself, his applications,
        and also will be used to deliver PUSH notifications
      </p><p>
        The websocket API supports multiple subprotocols identified each one
        with it's name:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
            push-notification
            <p>
              Simple protocol defined by Mozilla and Telefonica and described
              here:
              <a class="link" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush/Protocol" target="">

    Also know as "Simple push protocol" and defined by Mozilla and Telefonica.
  </p><p>
    This protocol is based in the
    <a class="link" href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/37474.pdf" target="">
      Thialfi protocol
    </a>.
    described by Google.
  </p><p>
    Also you can read more about this protocol in the Mozilla Wiki:
    <a class="link" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush/Protocol" target="">
      [https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush/Protocol]
    </a>.
  </p><p>
    In order to use this subprotocol, the "push-notification"
    string shall be sent into the websocket handsake headers.
  </p><p>
    All methods sent through this channel will have the same JSON structure:
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  
  {
    messageType: "&lt;type of message&gt;",
    ... other data ...
  }
  
  </pre><p>
    In which messageType defines one of these commands:
  </p><div class="section" title="hello"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"><a id="idp235080"/>hello</h6></div></div></div><p>
      With this method the device is able to register itself.
    </p><p>
      The device is responsible to give the server a valid UAID. If the
      provided UAID is not valid or is "null", the server will respond
      with a valid one.
    </p><p>
      In next connections the UAID given by the server SHALL be used.
    </p><p>
      When a device is registering to a notification server, it SHALL send
      his own valid UAID and also the device can send additional information
      that can be used to optimize the way the messages will be delivered
      to this device.
    </p><p>
      If it's not the first connection, the device can send a list of
      registered channels in order to syncronize client and server data.
      This mechanism allows a way to recover channels after a server crash.
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
    
    {
      messageType: "hello",
      uaid: "&lt;a valid UAToken&gt;",
      channelIDs: [&lt;a list of channels to sync [OPTIONAL]&gt;],
      interface: {
        ip: "&lt;current device IP address&gt;",
        port: "&lt;TCP or UDP port in which the device is waiting for wake up notifications&gt;"
      },
      mobilenetwork: {
        mcc: "&lt;Mobile Country Code&gt;",
        mnc: "&lt;Mobile Network Code&gt;"
      }
    }
    
    </pre><p>
      The interface and mobilenetwork optional data will be used by the server
      to identify if it has the required infrastructure into the user's mobile
      network in order to send wakeup messages to the IP and port indicated
      in the interface data so it's able to close the WebSocket channel to reduce
      signalling and battery consume.
    </p><p>
      The channelIDs array is sent by the client in order to synchronize server
      and client.
    </p><p>
      When the server receives a new hello message and the UAID provided by the
      client is a valid one (in other words, is the same returned to the client)
      the channelIDs list will be used to syncronize the server information with
      the client one.
    </p><p>
      For example, after a server crash, all client channels
      will be recovered with this simple method.
    </p><p>
      Another example, if the client uninstalled an app when the handset was
      offline, next time it connects will send tne channel list with one less,
      so the server will unregister this channel.
    </p><p>
      The server response can be one of these:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
      
      {
        messageType: "hello",
        uaid: "&lt;a valid UAID&gt;",
        status: 200
      }
      
      </pre><p>
      if it's connected through a permanent websocket, or:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
      
      {
        messageType: "hello",
        uaid: "&lt;a valid UAID&gt;",
        status: 201
      }
      
      </pre><p>
      if it's connected to a wakeup channel (UDP).
      </p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        This hello response differenciation is pending to change
        in order to use Websocket close status:

        </a>.
      </div><p>
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
      
      {
        messageType: "hello",
        status: 4xx,
        reason: "&lt;any reason&gt;"
      }
      
      </pre><p>
      on any error case, like:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">460: Error registering UAID</li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
      This method is also used to anounce a new IP address or a network change.
    </p><p>
      <img src="resources/seqdiags/change_ip.png" style="text-align: middle" width="450"/>
    </p></div><div class="section" title="register"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"><a id="idp244344"/>register</h6></div></div></div><p>
      This method is used to register push channels. Each application can
      register as many channels as it wants. Each channel maintains an
      independent counter about the last version of the channel.
    </p><p>
      This shall be send to the notification server after a valid UA
      registration.
    </p><p>
      Normally, this method will be used each time an application requires a
      new channel to receive Thialfi like notifications. A new endpoint URL
      will be delivered (through the WA-UA API).
    </p><p>
      No data is required at application level, only the UA client is
      responsible to generate a unique channelID for the handset. The channelID
      can be the same in different devices since the UAID will be used in the
      endpoint URL hash.
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
    
    {
      messageType: "register",
      channelID: "&lt;a new channelID&gt;"

      If it's needed a way to maintaint the socket open along time, a PING-PONG
      mechanism is also implemented.
    </p><p>
      The client sents the text "PING" and the server will respond "PONG".

      A more refined version is on working
      <a class="link" href="https://github.com/telefonicaid/notification_server/pull/137" target="">
        on this Github Pull Request
      </a>.

  </p></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section" title="API between the Application Server and the Notification Server"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="api_as_ns"/>API between the Application Server and the Notification Server</h2></div></div></div><p>
    This chapter explains the different APIs available to third party servers
  </p><div xml:lang="en" class="section" title="Simple PUSH API"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="api_as_ns_simplepush"/>Simple PUSH API</h3></div></div></div><p>
    With this API the Application server is able to update version number to
    specified channel.
  </p><p>
    This is a simple HTTP API (PUT method).
  </p><p>
    This version accepts only one HTTP PUT method used to update version number
    of a channel. The following payload SHALL be POSTED to the endpointURL:
    <code class="code">https://server:port/v1/notify/SOME_RANDOM_TOKEN</code>
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
    
    version=&lt;version_number&gt;
    
    </pre><p>
    and for desktop notifications:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
    
    body=&lt;any text&gt;[&amp;ttl=&lt;ttl&gt;]
    
    </pre><p>
  </p><p>
    The server response can be one of the following:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">STATUS: 200</li><li class="listitem">STATUS: 404 = Channel not found</li><li class="listitem">STATUS: 404 = Bad body received</li><li class="listitem">STATUS: 404 = Bad version received</li></ul></div><p>
  </p></div></div><div class="section" title="API between the WA and the AS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="api_wa_as"/>API between the WA and the AS</h2></div></div></div><p>
      This is a third party API which is independent of the PUSH protocol, so
      it's out of the scope of this document.
    </p><p>
      Anyway, through this API the publicURL received by the application should
      be send to his server.
    </p><p>
      Also this channel could be used to receive valid WATokens to be used during
      the WA registration.
    </p></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section" title="Tokens"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="api_tokens"/>Tokens</h2></div></div></div><p>
    The tokens are an important part of this API since it identifies each
    (user) actor (device and applications) in a unique or shared way.
  </p><div class="section" title="channelID"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp271104"/>channelID</h3></div></div></div><p>
      This token identifies the user or group of users and on extended API
      SHALL be a secret but in simple push API (thialfi like) it's not needed
      to be a secret.
    </p><p>
      If this token is UNIQUE (and secret, of course) will identify a unique
      instance of the application related (normally) to one user. In this case
      the returned URL will be unique for this channelID. On simple push, each
      device with same channelID will receive a unique endpointURL.
    </p><p>
      If this token is shared by different devices of the SAME user (and secret),
      will identify a unique user with multiple devices. In this case, the returned
      URL will be unique per user but each URL will identify multiple devices
      the user is using.
    </p><div class="example"><a id="idp272888"/><p class="title"><b>Example 3.1. Multiple device messages</b></p><div class="example-contents"><p>
        This can be used by applications in which the user require the same
        information across his devices, like the mobile and the desktop app.
        Can be used, for example, by e-mail clients.
      </p></div></div><br class="example-break"/><p>
      Finally, if a developer decides to deliver the same WAToken to all his users
      (in this cases is obviously not a secret one), then the returned URL will
      identify all instances of the same application. In this case each notification
      received in the publicURL will be delivered to ALL the devices which have
      the application installed (and registered). This will be a BROADCAST message.
    </p><div class="example"><a id="idp274416"/><p class="title"><b>Example 3.2. Message broadcast</b></p><div class="example-contents"><p>
        This can be used by applications in which all users require exactly the
        same information at the same time, like weather applications, latest news, ...
      </p></div></div><br class="example-break"/></div><div class="section" title="UAID"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp275344"/>UAID</h3></div></div></div><p>
      This token identifies each customer device in a unique way.
    </p><p>
      This token is also used as an identification key since this isn't a random
      one. This token is an AES encrypted string which will be checked for
      validaty each time it's used.
    </p></div><div class="section" title="endpointURL"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp276496"/>endpointURL</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Automatic generated token by the notification server which identifies the
      application + user/device as in a unique fashion.
    </p><p>
      This token is included in the publicURL which identifies the application,
      and normally is a SHA256 hashed string with the WATokent + the Public Key.

      When the handset is inside a mobile operator network, we can close the
      websocket to reduce battery comsuption and also network resources.
    </p><p>
      So, when the NS has messages to the WA installed on a concrete UA it will
      send a UDP Datagram to the handset.
    </p><p>
      When the mobile receives this datagram, it SHALL connect to the websocket
      interfaces in order to pull all pending messages.
